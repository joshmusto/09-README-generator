# README Generator

## Description

README files are a vital part of any professional program. They're what makes a program accessible through description and instruction. Without a proper README, many people may not even give a program a second glance, but writing one also takes away from valuable time that could be spent programming. Luckily, this program will help you make a quality README *and* save you time doing it. 

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
